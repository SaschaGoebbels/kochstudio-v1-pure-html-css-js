# kochstudio-v1-pure-html-css-js
Recipe App used just HTML CSS and JS

This is my first coding atempt and i am still lerning ervery day ! 
My Goal with this Project is practice my coding skills. 

And also i have a lot of fun to use this App by my self ! 
The fun part is the conincedience functionality with just one click you can decide, by coincidence what to cook next!

The functionality are not complete developt at some point i decided to switch to React to also learn some Framework skills !

To check out the actual Version on React you can go to my Repo => Kochstudio-React!
